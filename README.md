Examples of GrokkingAlgorithms book in C# language.

1. Binary search: This is an algorithm that works only in sorted lists.The average runtime is O(log n)
2. Selection sort: This is an algorithm for sorting a list.The average runtime is O(n^2).
3. Recursion: An example of recursion is get Factorial of a number.
4. Quick sort: This is the faster algorithm for sorting number arrays. The average runtime is O(n * log n)
